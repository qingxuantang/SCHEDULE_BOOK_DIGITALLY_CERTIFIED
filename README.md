# schedule_book
A ready-for-print schedule binder inspired by Bullet Journal.

## Key Components:
1. To-do-list & Avoid-at-all-cost-list.
2. Yearly Blueprint, general planning of each project on "To-do-list". This is the Blueprint of each project and works as Yearly Planning as well.
3. Monthly Calendar.
4. Monthly Log (Gantt Chart), for better tracking of monthly tasks with help of Gantt Chart.
5. Weekly Tracking Sheet(WTS), weekly planning of all ongoing tasks, Gantt style progression bar included.

## Files:
1. There is a PDF version for all sections.
2. Visio Format: Yearly Blueprint, Monthly Calendar, Monthly Log(Gantt Chart).
3. Spreadsheet Format: Weekly Tracking Sheet with both current version and past versions.
4. The integrated binder of the completed schedule book is only in PDF format.

## Print Layout Suggestion:
You can always print all the sections in A4 paper, however, if you are looking for something like a neat little notebook like me, you can print all the landscape layout versions in A4 and then fold them in half, which is exactly the A5 size.
